                        question: "How much does it cost to make a 3D game?",
                        answer: "The cost of developing a 3D game varies widely. Basic 2D mobile games range from $5,000 to $30,000, while complex 3D games for mobile development can cost between $100,000 and $500,000 or more. Understanding the project scope and budget beforehand helps avoid unexpected costs."

                    {
                        question: "What does a 3D game developer do?",
                        answer: "A 3D game developer combines graphic design, technology, art, and storytelling to create interactive games. They design new games or enhance existing ones by writing code to improve features and functionality, providing comprehensive 3D game development services."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "Which is cheaper, Unity or Unreal?",
                        answer: "Generally, Unity is cheaper because it caps fees at 2.5% of gross revenue, making it more affordable than Unreal. However, for gross revenues between $200,000 and $1,000,000, Unity's subscription costs can make it more expensive than Unreal."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "Is Unreal or Unity better for 3D?",
                        answer: "For superior graphics, Unreal is better suited to your needs. While Unity is versatile and user-friendly, Unreal provides high-quality, realistic visuals, making it the preferred choice for graphically intensive 3D games."
                    },
                    {
                        question: "How much does AAA game development cost?",
                        answer: "The average cost to develop AAA games by a top-grade 3D game development company with entry-level to mid-level features ranges from $60 million to $80 million. However, incorporating cutting-edge and superior features and visuals can drive the cost up to $100 million or more."

                    {
                        question: "What coding language is used for 3D games?",
                        answer: "For graphically rich, expansive 3D games, C++ is commonly used. It offers speed, direct hardware access, and fine-grained control over memory management, maximizing performance by efficiently using GPU capabilities and memory budgets."
