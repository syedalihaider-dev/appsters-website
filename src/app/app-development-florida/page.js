              "What is the average cost of developing a mobile app in Florida?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                Developing a mobile app involves significant investment. App
                developers in Florida typically charge around $45 per hour.
                Considering the complexities of building native apps for both
                iOS and Android, with an estimated effort of 1200-1500 hours,
                costs can exceed $100,000. However, BitsWits offers competitive
                rates thanks to our international presence, delivering
                high-quality apps for $25k to $40k.

            question: "Should I build separate versions for Android and iOS?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                The decision depends on your target audience and business
                objectives. Native apps provide superior performance and user
                experience but require separate development efforts.
                Cross-platform development, on the other hand, allows you to
                reach a broader audience with reduced costs and time.

            question: "Are there limitations to cross-platform development?",
            answer: (
              <p>
                While cross-platform development offers cost and time
                efficiencies, it may not match the performance or user
                experience of native apps. Additionally, cross-platform apps
                might have limitations accessing platform-specific features.

              <p>
                No, most app development companies in Florida, including
                BitsWits, offer flexible payment options such as milestone-based
                payments. With the app development cost divided into multiple
                stages like Alpha, Beta, etc. you can proactively plan your
                budget with confidence and make sure the research and strategy
                phases of your startup are aligned with the development
                perfectly.

                  At BitsWits, we employ Agile methodology for efficient app
                  development. Agile methodology breaks projects into manageable

                  Agile fosters collaboration, feedback integration, and
                  continuous improvement, resulting in faster time-to-market and
                  higher quality deliverables. Clients benefit from active
                  participation, reduced risks, and solutions that meet their
                  evolving needs. With Agile, we prioritize client satisfaction
