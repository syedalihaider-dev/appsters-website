                3D modeling involves creating the objects, characters, and
                environments in the game, while animation involves giving
                movement and behavior to those models. This is typically done
                using specialized software tools like Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max.{" "}

                Physics in 3D games involves simulating real-world physical
                interactions, such as gravity, collisions, and forces. Game

                1. Optimizing performance in 3D games is crucial for smooth
                gameplay. Considerations include:Level of Detail (LOD): Use
                lower-polygon models for objects that are farther away from the
                camera.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Occlusion Culling: Hide objects that are not currently
                visible to the camera.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. Texture Compression: Use compressed textures to save memory
                and improve loading times.
                <br />
                <br />
                Efficient Rendering: Utilize techniques like frustum culling to
                only render objects within the camera's view.{" "}
