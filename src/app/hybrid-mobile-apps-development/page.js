              <>

                A hybrid mobile app is a type of mobile application that
                combines elements of both native and web applications. It is
                built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and
                wrapped in a native container for distribution.

              "What are the advantages of hybrid mobile app development?",
            answer: (
              <>

                1. Cost-effective development. <br />
                <br />
                2. Cross-platform compatibility. <br />
                <br />
                3. Faster development cycles. <br />
                <br />
                4. Access to device features through plugins. <br />
                <br />
                5. Single codebase for multiple platforms.

              "Which frameworks are commonly used for hybrid mobile app development?",
            answer: (
              <>

                Ionic, React Native, Xamarin, PhoneGap (Cordova), and Flutter
                are popular frameworks for hybrid mobile app development.

            question: "How does a hybrid app differ from a native app?",
            answer: (
              <>

                Native apps are developed for a specific platform (iOS or
                Android) using platform-specific languages (Swift/Obj-C for iOS,
                Java/Kotlin for Android), while hybrid apps use web technologies
                and can run on multiple platforms.

            ),
          },
          {
            question: "Are hybrid apps as performant as native apps?",
            answer: (
              <>

                Hybrid apps might not perform as well as native apps in certain
                scenarios, especially for graphics-intensive or complex
                applications. However, advancements in hybrid frameworks have
                improved performance significantly.

          },

            question: "What is the role of WebView in hybrid app development?",
            answer: (
              <>

                WebView is a component that allows displaying web content within
                a native app. In hybrid development, the WebView is used to
                render the user interface of the application.
