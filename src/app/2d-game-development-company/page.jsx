                In 2D game development, a sprite is a 2D image or animation that
                represents an object or character in the game. A texture, on the
                other hand, is a 2D image used to apply visual details to

                Collision detection in 2D games involves identifying when two or
                more objects in the game world come into contact. This can be
                achieved through various techniques, such as bounding box
                collision, pixel-perfect collision, or using physics engines

                Design considerations for 2D games include:Game mechanics:
                Define how the game will be played and what actions are

                <br />
                <br />
                Art and animation: Create or acquire 2D sprites, backgrounds,

                <br />
                <br />
                Level design: Plan and design the layout and challenges of game

                <br />
                <br />
                User interface (UI) design: Create menus, HUD elements, and
