                      Cross-platform apps are applications that can run on multiple
                      operating systems, such as iOS and Android. Popular examples of
                      cross-platform apps include social media networks like Twitter,
                      Facebook, and Instagram; messaging services like WhatsApp,

                      Google Drive, and iCloud; productivity tools like Evernote,
                      Slack, and Trello; and gaming services like Apple Arcade, Google
                      Play Games and Xbox Live. These apps have become essential for
                      staying connected across multiple devices and platforms.
                      Ultimately, the list of cross-platform apps is as long as your

                      are there's a cross-platform app that can help you stay
                      connected and productive. And since it works on multiple

                      code specifically for each platform. By utilizing cross-platform

                      various frameworks available such as React Native, Flutter,
                      Ionic, and Xamarin that allow developers to create apps for

                      languages like Dart are designed with the intent to create

                      Cross-platform apps are applications that can run on multiple
