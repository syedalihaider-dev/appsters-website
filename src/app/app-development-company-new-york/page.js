                answer: (
                  <p>
                    Building a software or mobile application is both
                    complicated and expensive. App developers in New York City
                    usually charge an average of $45 per hour. Similarly,
                    front-end developers, designers, project managers, etc.
                    charge more or less the same hourly rate. Assuming you’re
                    building native apps for both iOS and Android, and your LOE
                    is somewhere around 1200 - 1500 for a single version, the
                    cost of app development could easily go above $100,000. And
                    that’s where BitsWits come to help!
                    <br />
                    BitsWits has offices in around 7 countries with production
                    houses across Pakistan, UAE, and the USA. The hourly rates
                    are cheaper here with slightly better development quality.
                    Thus, if you work with us, you can easily get the same app
                    within $25k to $40k.

                answer: (
                  <p>
                    Building separate Android and iOS versions of your app
                    depends on your target audience and business goals. While
                    native apps offer better performance and user experience,
                    they require separate development for each platform.
                    Alternatively, you can opt for cross-platform app
                    development to save time and resources while reaching a

                    While cross-platform app development offers benefits like
                    reduced development time and cost, there are some drawbacks
                    to consider. Cross-platform apps may not offer the same
                    level of performance or user experience as native apps. They
                    may also have limitations in accessing platform-specific

                  "How much does mobile app development cost in New York?",
                answer: (
                  <p>
                    Building a software or mobile application is both
                    complicated and expensive. App developers in New York City
                    usually charge an average of $45 per hour. Similarly,
                    front-end developers, designers, project managers, etc.
                    charge more or less the same hourly rate. Assuming you’re
                    building native apps for both iOS and Android, and your LOE
                    is somewhere around 1200 - 1500 for a single version, the
                    cost of app development could easily go above $100,000. And
                    that’s where BitsWits come to help!
                    <br />
                    BitsWits has offices in around 7 countries with production
                    houses across Pakistan, UAE, and the USA. The hourly rates
                    are cheaper here with slightly better development quality.
                    Thus, if you work with us, you can easily get the same app
                    within $25k to $40k.

                answer: (
                  <p>
                    Building separate Android and iOS versions of your app
                    depends on your target audience and business goals. While
                    native apps offer better performance and user experience,
                    they require separate development for each platform.
                    Alternatively, you can opt for cross-platform app
                    development to save time and resources while reaching a
                    wider audience.

                answer: (
                  <p>
                    While cross-platform app development offers benefits like
                    reduced development time and cost, there are some drawbacks
                    to consider. Cross-platform apps may not offer the same
                    level of performance or user experience as native apps. They
                    may also have limitations in accessing platform-specific
                    features and capabilities.

                    <p>
                      No, you don't have to pay all at once for mobile app
                      development. Most app development companies offer flexible
                      payment options, including milestone-based payments.

                  <p>
                    You can hire a freelance app developer in NYC if you already
                    have an existing in-house team and need to augment it for
                    better results. Besides that, hiring a freelance app
                    developer is not the right approach. While it might seem a
                    little cost effective and monitorable, the overall cost and
                    results are not guaranteed and the only person who's
                    accountable for any mishap is you. At the same time, hiring
                    an app development company in NYC like BitsWits gives you
                    freedom to be as flexible and customizable as you want.
                    Plus, you can check the portfolio of an app development
